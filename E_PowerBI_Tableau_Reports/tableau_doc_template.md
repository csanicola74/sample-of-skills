### Tableau Dashboard Documentation Template

This template will guide you in documenting the process of creating a Tableau dashboard with detailed instructions, descriptions, and rationale for each step. It ensures that someone else can recreate the dashboard from scratch. Below is a structured guide to documenting the dashboard creation process:

### 1. **Project Overview**

#### **1.1 Project Goal:**

Clearly define the purpose of the dashboard. For example:

- _Goal_: To provide sales performance insights by region and product category.

#### **1.2 Key Stakeholders:**

- List the individuals or teams who will be using or reviewing the dashboard.

#### **1.3 Data Sources:**

- List each data source used (e.g., SQL Database, Excel files, etc.).
- Provide the connection details or credentials needed to access the data.

#### **1.4 Audience:**

- Define the intended audience for the dashboard and their data consumption needs.

---

### 2. **Setup**

#### **2.1 Required Software and Tools:**

- **Tableau Desktop version:** Specify the exact version of Tableau used.
- **Additional tools:** (if needed) Specify any additional tools used, e.g., Excel, Alteryx, etc.

#### **2.2 Initial Data Preparation:**

Provide detailed steps on how the data should be prepared before it is brought into Tableau:

- E.g., "Remove unnecessary columns, clean up null values in Excel."

#### **2.3 Connection to Data Sources:**

- _Step 1:_ Open Tableau Desktop and navigate to the "Connect" pane on the left.
- _Step 2:_ Select the correct data source (e.g., Microsoft Excel, Server).
- _Step 3:_ Provide step-by-step instructions on connecting to the data source (e.g., database connection string, Excel file path).

---

### 3. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**

#### **3.1 Data Preparation in Tableau:**

- Explain if any data joins, unions, or data extracts are necessary.
- _Step 1:_ "Join the Sales table and Region table using the Region ID field."
- _Step 2:_ "Rename columns for consistency (e.g., change 'RegionID' to 'Region')."

#### **3.2 Filters and Parameters:**

- Define the filters you will use (e.g., date ranges, specific categories).
- _Step 1:_ "Create a Date Range filter by dragging the Date field to the Filters shelf and selecting the relevant range."
- _Step 2:_ "Create a 'Region' filter by dragging 'Region' to the Filters shelf."

---

### 4. **Building the Dashboard**

#### **4.1 Worksheets:**

For each worksheet, describe the following:

- _Name of Worksheet_: (e.g., "Sales by Region")
- _Data Source_: (e.g., "Sales Data 2023")
- _Fields used_: List each field and explain why it was selected (e.g., “Region – used to break down sales performance by region”).
- _Type of chart/visualization_: Explain why you selected the specific chart (e.g., "Bar Chart to show regional comparison").

#### **4.2 Visualizations:**

Describe each visualization and its components:

- _Visualization Type_: (e.g., bar chart, line chart, scatter plot).
- _Axis setup_: (e.g., "X-axis: Region, Y-axis: Sales").
- _Color Scheme_: Provide details on the colors used and their significance.
- _Calculated Fields_: Describe any calculated fields used in the visualization (e.g., Profit Margin = SUM(Profit) / SUM(Sales)).

#### **4.3 Layout and Design:**

- Explain the dashboard layout and structure, including specific positioning of elements:
  - E.g., "Place the 'Sales by Region' bar chart in the top-left quadrant."
- Describe font choices, colors, and other design elements, explaining the reasoning behind them (e.g., “Use blue for positive values and red for negative values”).

---

### 5. **Interactivity and Functionality**

#### **5.1 Filters:**

- Define how filters should be applied across worksheets.
  - E.g., "Use a global filter on 'Region' to filter all visualizations by selected region."

#### **5.2 Parameters:**

- Describe any parameters used and their impact on the dashboard.
  - E.g., "Create a 'Date Range' parameter to allow users to dynamically select a specific time range."

#### **5.3 Actions:**

- Detail any user interaction actions set up (e.g., filter, highlight).
  - _Step 1:_ "Set up a Filter Action from the 'Sales by Region' chart to filter the 'Sales by Product Category' chart."
  - _Step 2:_ "Highlight Action to emphasize the selected region in other visualizations."

---

### 6. **Validation and Testing**

#### **6.1 Data Accuracy:**

- Explain how to validate that the data is correctly represented in the dashboard.
  - E.g., "Cross-check sales figures against the original data source to ensure no discrepancies."

#### **6.2 Performance Optimization:**

- Describe any optimization steps taken to ensure the dashboard performs well.
  - E.g., "Use data extracts to reduce load time for large datasets."

---

### 7. **Final Deployment**

#### **7.1 Publishing to Tableau Server/Online:**

- Provide instructions for publishing the dashboard to Tableau Server/Online, including access permissions.
  - _Step 1:_ "Click File > Publish to Server."
  - _Step 2:_ "Set permissions to allow only specific users to view or edit."

#### **7.2 Sharing and Permissions:**

- Describe how to share the dashboard with stakeholders.
  - E.g., "Send the published link with a read-only role to ensure data security."

---

### **Appendices (Optional)**

- **Data Dictionary**: Define each field and its purpose in the dashboard.
- **Additional Notes**: Provide any other instructions or contextual details.

This template can be adapted based on the complexity of the dashboard and any specific organizational needs. Each section ensures that the dashboard can be effectively recreated by another user.
